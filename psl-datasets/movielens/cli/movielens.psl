// Similarities like Pearson, Cosine, and Adjusted Cosine Similarity between items.
1.0 : rated(U,I1) & rated(U,I2) & rating(U,I1) & sim_items(I1,I2) >> rating(U,I2)^2

// Similarities like Pearson and Cosine Similarity between users.
1.0 : rated(U1,I) & rated(U2,I) & rating(U1,I) & sim_users(U1,U2) >> rating(U2,I)^2

// Predictions by different other methods like SGD, Item based Pearson methods, and BPMF methods.

// Average prior of user rating and item ratings.
// These two rules can be captured in preprocess by standardizing the user ratings
// between 0 and 1 where the average user rating is 0.5
// Filter out users who haven't rate more than 1 movie
